# Tulas Questions Set 1

## For You To Think

- **If your single backend server crashes, your entire application crashes. Why do big companies never rely on one server, and why do beginners still start with one?**
- **Why can one computer not handle 1 TB of data efficiently, but 10 weak computers working together can? Explain the fundamental concept behind this.**
- **If a database can store millions of records, why do companies still need Hadoop, Spark, NoSQL, caching, and distributed storage systems?**
- **What actually happens internally when millions of users open the same website at the same time? Why doesn’t the server explode, and what architecture handles this?**
- **If microservices are so powerful, why do almost all startups begin with monoliths? What does this tell you about business vs engineering?**
- **Why does scaling a backend become useless if the database cannot scale? What makes databases the real bottleneck in large systems?**
- **Why is analyzing data more valuable than collecting it? What does a company lose when it only collects data but never analyzes it?**
- **Why does MapReduce break huge files into small chunks and send these chunks to different machines? Why not just load the full file on one strong machine?**
- **Why do companies track every click, scroll, search, and button press on a website? What is the real business reason behind collecting this data?**
- **Why is distributed architecture not just a technical choice but a necessity for any company serving millions of users? What problem does it solve that cannot be solved by a single powerful machine?**
